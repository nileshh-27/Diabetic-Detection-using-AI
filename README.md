# ðŸ§  Diabetes Prediction System (ML + Visual Insights)

This project is a **Machine Learning-powered Diabetes Prediction System** that predicts whether a user is diabetic based on health metrics like glucose, insulin, BMI, and age. It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** along with custom **Feature Engineering** and **Weight of Evidence (WoE) Encoding** for enhanced accuracy and interpretability.

The system includes **visualizations** that help users and healthcare professionals understand the prediction more effectively.
